<p>RossPens.Com is a site specializing in the sale of fountain pens, 
primarily restored vintage pens. I pride myself as a reliable source of working pens, accurately described. All our pens are guaranteed be as described and to work as they should. I'd rather you know the imperfections before you buy, hopefully reminding you that a 40 year old pen may not look as it did when came straight out of the box. But the real joy in these old pens is how they write: smoothed by years of use. I do my best to describe the character of the pen, as well as its condition.</p>
